## The reason behind it

It is a bit off-topic for this blog but I think it is still a good way to open it. 

I've always thought that I was not the best person to create a blog (I still do a bit) since I am a bit lazy to write this kind of stuff. So what made me change my mind... after many years of reading other blogs and books that encouraged to create one because it is a good way to record experiences and share with others I thought I would give it a try, so here it is born my blog towards my experiences in testing and test automation overall.

## How to create a github.io blog

After searching for a bit I've found some distinct results on how it is possible to achieve this, so upon some careful reading of my results I've decided to use this [tutorial](https://youngkin.github.io/post/createafreeblogsite/) written by [Rick Youngkin](https://youngkin.github.io/top/about/). Since the same tutorial dates from the time when the author created is blog some stuff might not work totally fine so you might need to work out your way a bit in the theme `layouts > partials` html so you can tweak a bit your blog.

Since I've searched other pages I leave here the other links that I've also seen.
